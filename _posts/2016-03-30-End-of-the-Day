Well, that's a wrap on another day. I was hoping to get more done today on the MeleeSystem script, as it is though I did manage
to introduce some of the changes I had planned. The script can now swap out some predefined sounds and particle systems when
hitting objects that are tagged differently. At the moment I with just four 'materials'; metal, plastic, glass, and flesh.
It will be pretty easy to expand the list of materials as needed(I'm thinking of adding ceramic or stone).  I can even 
reuse these tags later for the footstep audioclip swap system. 

I also went ahead and put together a script for the second weapon's mechanics.
The second weapon is a sort of makeshift particle beam that was cobbled together by a few talented individuals whose efforts
you will inherit later in the game. The weapon has a long recharge time but fires powerful bursts that do damage in a large radius.
The scripts for both of these are up in the greenfive repository.

When time allows tommorow, I'm planning to finish out the melee system script by adding the decal instantiation, the alternate attack
function, and the block ability.
