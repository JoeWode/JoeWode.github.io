Today I posted a new SuperEarlyPreAlpha build, and then had to post a new fixed version. There are only a few new additions to this
build: An animated health bar for the player HUD, and the first weapon is in the game now. The first weapon is just a metal pipe,
which is a little nod to SystemShock (the first weapon there was a lead pipe).

The next step I plan on taking is to add some more complexity to the melee combat system. Right now there is only one attack type, a
simple swing attack. I plan to add a thrusting attack that can be used to push back enemies. There will also be a way to block damage.
There are also instantiated decals which need to be added. I also need to create a few more particle systems and find a few sound clips
so that striking different materials with the pipe will generate different sounds and cause different particles to be emitted at the
point of impact.

I think I may have found a way to address the lighting issues I've been having, if so I may include the next scene in the next build.
