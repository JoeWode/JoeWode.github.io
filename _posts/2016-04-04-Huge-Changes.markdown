So, I spent the weekend learning some vital new things about coding. For a while now I've felt that I needed to reorganize and
colsolidate my code, but I wasn't quite sure how to do it. Then, accidentally really, I stumbled upon a series of tutorials that
made what I needed to do very, very clear. I need an event system.

I've also decided to greatly minimize the role that fungus currently plays in the project. It will mostly be delegated to streamlining
the utilization of some UI elements as well as a few other minor things related to plot pacing and story presentation.

Today, I plan to continue with coding the new event system and finishing the design on the player progression system and inventory system.
Later on I'll post details about player progression in greenfive.

On a side note, I can't believe it took me this long to find out about event systems. I mean, I've been self-teaching myself C# for about
6 months now, and in all my travels around the interweb and back looking for information, event systems never even came up once. How is this
possible? It makes me wonder if there are other huge gaps in my knowledge. It also makes me wonder if I need to be much more careful about 
who I learn from. I mean, I've learned more about proper coding procedures in the past day than I have in the past 6 months.

And I learned it from this guy: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-5-fps-tutorials-gtgd-s3-advanced-first-person-shooter.360105/
