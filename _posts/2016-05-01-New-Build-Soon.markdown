Well the build was delayed quite a bit, but not because I haven't been busy. The code overhaul was actually completed a while ago.
I've been implementing new systems for the game and i wanted them to be complete before I released a new build. I also wanted there
to actually be something for the player to do other than a few incomplete story actions and smacking things with a pipe. Honestly, I
probably shouldn't be releasing anything at all until I hit the alpha stage.

I will probably do one more pre-alpha build before then however just to show off some of what I've been working on.

Speaking of which, the new inventory system is live. Players can pick up, throw, drop, or store items they find in the environment.
At the moment this is simply health pickups, ammo, and weapons. I'm working on a few deployable items like mines and sentries and 
grenades of different types. The player can now enter cyberspace at designated terminals, however, there isn't much to do there as
of yet. NPC and enemies are now in the game, the AI is still pretty preliminary at this point but you can fight with and talk to 
them respectively. Destructible items are also live.

Now I need to set up event handlers for the player's augment system and for cyberspace interactions/combat. After that I'll mostly 
shift focus toward polishing the systems and fine-tuning them.

I also need to put together a few more assets so I can finish prototyping the rest of the scenes in chapter 1. I should have a build 
out by sometime mid-week.
