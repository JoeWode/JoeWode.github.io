The code overhaul continues. Most of the old functionality has been replaced at this point and the basic functionality of the
inventory system is complete. I need to set up a few more events to deal with fungus blocks, set some limits on the inventory and
add the ability to drop and maybe even place objects (right now you can only throw them). I've also decided to revamp the melee 
system to use collisions instead of raycasting so that combat will feel more realistic and satisfying.

I've also made some decisions regarding player progression. At first I'd thought of using an exp based point system that players
could spend on stat upgrades which would grant various passive bonuses to things like melee damage, move speed, increasing
health/enegry pools, etc. Then I thought of using a system similar to Skyrim where skills had a chance to increase with use.
Finally I've settled on a system of 'augments' or special skills that the player unlocks by progressing through the story. Right
now the list of these abilities includes:

-Neural Interface: this is the first augment the player unlocks. It will allow the player to enter cyberspace and 'hack' into 
various terminals. This can effect various things in the physical environment such as opening doors, shutting off power, activating
or co-opting remote defences, remote recon, and retrieval of information related to story progression.  

-Combined Stealth: grants the player short term invisibility for bypassing security systems and enemy patrols by providing the 
player with optical camouflage and accoustic dampeners. Physical contact will disrupt the cloaking effect however, so the player 
will not be able to attack more than once while stealthed.  

-Active Denial System: grants the player the ability to emit a bright flash of light coupled with an ultrasonic burst. Any enemies
caught in the radius are left disoriented and vulnerable. Can be used for quick escapes or to bypass enemy defensive capabilities.  

-Nanophage Deconstructor: grants the player the ability to break down objects to replenish either health or energy depending on 
whether the object is organic or inorganic.  

Augment activation is controlled by an energy pool as well as refresh rates on the various abilities. How the player plays the game
will also have an effect on the way the game plays. If the player engages in too many violent or otherwise destructive actions it
will effect how NPCs respond to the player. This is the basic scheme for the various NPC 'affinty' levels:  
[helpful<>positive<>neutral<>hated<>horrified]  
The idea is to have the NPCs respond to the player differently based on these states. These states may also become faction specific,
with different faction responding differently to player actions, either approving or disapproving. It's also time to make a decision 
about A.I. - whether I should take the time to code my own or just use RAIN.

The next build may be delayed a bit.
